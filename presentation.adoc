=== The Axiom

> Comments are always failures.

(Some guy with a book.)

He's wrong!

> *Comment Your &x☠# Code*
>
> 10:20 - 11:10 +
> (right after this one) +
> Room 3


=== Self Documenting Code

I don't care about your code!

I want to know what happens when I use it!

* pre- & postconditions
* what return value can I expect?
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* good names, small methods, SOLID, ... don't help here
* observed behavior != contract
* how many interface implementations am I supposed to check?
* what if I have to implement an interface?
* You're code is not a special snowflake - it's the all singing all dancing crap of the world.
* I am in a hurry and have to get shit done.
--


=== Tests

I care even less about your tests!

How do you test this?

* "for all" propositions
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* do you have tests for interfaces?
* test coverage better be > 90%.
--


=== Tests

Ever heard *RTFT*? +
(Read The &*☠# Tests) +


No?

What was I thinking about?


=== Comments Age

That's like saying +
"Car's crash".

So? Do we get rid of them?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* crashes are caused by negligence
* are often punishable by law
* do not harm the overall benefit
--


=== Comments Age

What about names?

* do they age?
* do you update them?

Yes?!

Then update the comments, too!


[data-background="images/comment-your-fucking-code.jpg"]

== The Costs Of Comments

or

+++<h2>Why Everybody Hates Comments</h2>+++


=== Initial Composition

Writing a comment is harder...

* ... the later it is done
* ... the more complex the code is
* ... the more precise the comment is

Usually affordable +
compared to writing code and tests.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* cost is capped when abstraction works well
--


=== Maintenance

What do to with comments +
when code changes?

* updating ⇝ takes time
* leaving unchanged ⇝ causes confusion
* deletion ⇝ wastes past efforts

Whatever schema you decide on +
*maintenance is critical*!


=== Maintenance

* *changing* comments takes little time
* but *finding* them can be hard

⇝ Comments and code must be close!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* pesky, time-consuming, error-prone
--


=== Confusion

Comments that are

* outdated
* ambiguous
* lacking detail

cause confusion!


=== Confusion

Costs are unpredictable +
but potentially enormous!

Deteriorates trust in comments.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* good coding techniques reduce risk
--


=== Obstruction

Takes up screen space.

(Fold that shit!)


=== Why Everybody _Really_ Hates Comments

* they may be hard to write
* they turn nothing green
* nobody gets a pat on the back +
for a clever comment

++++
<p class="fragment current-visible">Get over it!</p>
++++



== The Benefits Of Comments

Small note: +
Benefits suffer from diminishing returns.


=== Explain What Happens

Duh!

* intrinsically redundant
* can cause confusion

Might be necessary +
for arcane language features.


=== Keep Abstractions Intact

Every unit of code provides an abstraction.

* do one thing and to it well
* hide how it does it
* should not require  us +
to look past the abstraction

The core to modularizing any non-trivial problem!


=== Keep Abstractions Intact

Abstractions provide two benefits:

* reuse code
* reuse understanding

Comments can help with both!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* abstractions lose value if I have to step into them
* tests, clean code, ... only shines then
* you have to build a new context
--


=== Top Down vs Bottom Up

* most people learn better top down
* clean code, tests, ... +
are a bottom up approach

Comments can be *signposts*, +
helping to stay on +
the right *level of abstraction*.


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* similar to keeping abstractions intact
--


=== Document Intent

Context is invaluable when revisiting code!

* why?
* no seriously, WHY?
* why the &*☠#?!


=== Document Intent

* other tools contain this info
* working through them takes time
* and is transient!

Comments can be 2nd line of defense.


=== Spur Redesign

> It’s funny how writing documentation can spur redesign:
it’s easier to simplify a complex API than try to document it completely.

(Mike Bostok https://twitter.com/mbostock/status/681561150127878144[on Twitter].)


== Looking Closer...

* actuality
* locality
* alternatives


=== Actuality

* some comments need to be very up-to-date
* others can be slightly or even totally outdated

This influences costs:

* maintenance
* confusion


=== Locality

How far can a comment be away +
from what it describes?

* some must basically be on the same line +
to make any sense at all
* others might span several concepts +
so they can be some classes away

It is hard to update far-away comments!


=== Alternatives

There are plenty of alternatives to comments.

But not all work for everything.

* clean code
* tests, demos
* version control
* issue tracker
* wiki



== What does it do?

```java
public int activeUserCountSince(Date date) {
	int activeUserCount = 0;
	// loop through the users
	for (User user : users)
		// check whether user logged in
		if (user.loggedInSince(date))
			// increase activeUserCount
			activeUserCount++;
	return activeUserCount;
}
```


=== Narrations

Usually inline comments.

* explain what the code does
* speak on a very technical level


=== Analysis

Actuality::
* very high
* need to be absolutely up to date!
Location::
* right in the narrated line(s)
Alternatives::
* good names
* transparent design
* well-known patterns


=== Costs

* *composition*: medium
* *maintenance*: high
* *confusion*: high risk
* *obstruction*: yes, can't be hidden


=== Benefits

* *explain what happens*: yes
* *keep abstractions intact*: no
* *top down over bottom up*: no
* *documenting intent*: a little


=== Verdict

> Narrations suck!

&nbsp;

With one exception:

* arcane language features are used
* there is no alternative
* there is no way to improve readability

	int size();
}</code></pre></div></div>
</div>
++++


=== Contract Comments

(or just _Contracts_)

Usually JavaDoc on classes and methods.

They define

* the code's central abstraction
* pre- and postconditions
* quirks

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* highlight "define" (not "describe")
* they make a promise
--


=== Analysis

Actuality::
* high
Location::
* right in the class or method
Alternatives::
* good names (limited)
* tests (limited)


=== Costs

* *composition*: high
* *maintenance*: considerable
* *confusion*: high risk
* *obstruction*:
** can be hidden
** and viewed on demand


=== Benefits

* *explain what happens*: yes
* *keep abstractions intact*: yes
* *top down over bottom up*: to a degree
* *documenting intent*: no


=== Verdict

> It's complicated.

&nbsp;

* costs are high if code changes often
* benefits are high if code is read often

⇝ The more stable & reused the code, +
the better the outcome!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* "resused" often implies "stable" by necessity
* good documentation improves discoverability and adoption
--

}</code></pre></div></div>
</div>
++++

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* another example: a class explaining that a factory is required
--


=== Technical Context

Often non-Javadoc blocks +
at the beginning of a class/method.

(Check out
http://blog.codefx.org/java/new-javadoc-tags/[`@apiNote` and `@implNote`].)

* clarify what code is _for_
* when to use it and when not

(This is *not* a contract!)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* can even give examples
* contracts make a promise, context comments explain why it was made
--


=== Analysis

Actuality::
* not that important
Location::
* not that important
Alternatives::
* demos
* existing code (limited)


=== Costs

* *composition*: moderate
* *maintenance*: not so much
* *confusion*: possible
* *obstruction*:
** can be hidden
** and viewed on demand


=== Benefits

* *explain what happens*: somewhat
* *keep abstractions intact*: a little
* *top down over bottom up*: to a degree
* *documenting intent*: yes


=== Verdict

> A clear winner!

&nbsp;

* costs are moderate
* benefits are considerable

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* avoid confusion with contracts
--

}</code></pre></div></div>

=== Historical Context

* clarifies why (oh why!) +
code looks the way it does
* can document paths not taken


=== Analysis

Actuality::
* negligible
Location::
* not that important
Alternatives::
* commit messages
* issues, wikis


=== Costs

* *composition*: moderate
* *maintenance*: negligible
* *confusion*: low
* *obstruction*: yes


=== Benefits

* *explain what happens*: somewhat
* *keep abstractions intact*: no
* *top down over bottom up*: no
* *documenting intent*: yes


=== Verdict

> Even better!

&nbsp;

* costs are negligible
* benefits are considerable

These are great breadcrumbs +
when tracking down bugs!



== Where Does This Leave Us?

Let's move away from

> All comments are failures.

Instead

> Comments are a tool to facilitate understanding.
> We should use it wisely!


=== Clean Comments

This is my proposal:

* avoid _narrations_ whenever possible
* always have a paragraph that explains +
a class's central abstraction
* add _contracts_ to reused APIs
* provide as much _context_ as possible

It must be obvious +
into which category a comment belongs!


=== Clean Comments

But the details depend on many factors:

* team:
** size
** technical backgrounds
* code base:
** size
** heterogeneity
** ownership


=== Clean Comments

So:

* get the team together and +
speak *freely* about comments
* go through the code base and +
*discuss* concrete examples
* settle on a *shared approach* and +
include it in your team's style guide
* use pair programming or code reviews +
to *adapt and enforce*
